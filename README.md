Example of an implementation of a Hash Table in JavaScript and Ruby
==============
You can find an adaptation for Ruby and JavaScript of the Java code from the book  Algorithms, 4th Edition
--------------
You can find the original code in Java on the [booksite](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

The code has been used for a presentation at a Peer-leed seminar organized by Launch School **Data Structures and Algorithms**
The file `hash_benchmarks.rb` is part of the seminar presentation.
It shows how performing a linear search using arrays has a time complexity of O(N) in the worst-case scenario.
Using a hash table the search takes constant time O(1).
